We briefly discussed the possible utility of tumor gene expression profiling in order to further inform his decision as to whether or not to pursue local therapy now. Tumor gene expression profiling can help to identify patients with tumor genetics more or less favorable and has been shown to have modest predictive value in stratifying long-term risk of metastatic spread.  In his case, the overall favorable characteristics of his tumor make his overall risk for distant metastasis within 10 years low.  Thus we do not recommend expression profiling at this time.

We briefly discussed the role of HIFU and FLA for his case. We discussed that these techniques are not as well established as a radical prostatectomy or radiation and are not considered a standard of care. We discussed that these procedures are typically more favorable from a side effect standpoint, but the control is neither considered to be standard nor as effective. Given his small volume disease and complex history with multiple additional risk factors for both EBRT and radical prostatectomy that the lower risk of side of effects and the ability to follow HIFU with more traditional treatment in the event of an early failure in some ways make this an attractive option for him.

We briefly discussed the possibility of obtaining treatment closer to home at Silver Cross Hospital.  Prior experience with patients requiring the type of treatment we would suggest for him, namely high-intensity ablative radiation with real-time motion tracking, are not available at all treatment centers.  We would recommend that if he decides to pursue EBRT that he do so here at UCH instead of a satellite office.
