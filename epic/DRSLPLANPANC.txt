@NAME@ is a @AGE@ old @SEX@ patient who presents with locally advanced,
borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer s/p *** cycles of *** with *** response. 
 
1. We discussed the natural history of borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer. If untreated, it is likely that disease will progress, either locally and/or distantly. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy alone, chemoRT, chemotherapy only, or observation. The best outcomes generally come with margin-negative surgery, but at this time, it is uncertain if this is possible based on the CT imaging.  

2. The primary goal of radiation therapy in this setting is to downstage the tumor and help improve the likelihood of complete surgical resection. We talked about the role of radiation therapy in the setting of borderline resectable disease. Randomized data in the up front setting show that concurrent chemoradiation can improve the chance for margin negative resection compared to no up front therapy. There is a moderate likelihood of local control with standard concurrent chemoradiation as stand-alone therapy without surgery, in case @HE@ cannot proceed to have it. 

3. The logistics and possible side effects of radiation therapy were discussed. Treatment with chemoradiation would occur on a Monday-Friday schedule over 5 weeks. Treatment would involve ~1 hour in our department for each session. Acute toxicity could include fatigue, skin irritation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, or weight loss. Late toxicity could arise months or even years after the completion of therapy and could include changes to the small bowel, which can be mild to moderate or severe. Severe toxicity may include ulceration or obstruction, which requires further workup and/or intervention to attempt to correct. There is a risk of severe and permanent damage to any irradiated tissue, although the risk of such damage is low. Regarding the risks of radiation therapy, @HE@ had an opportunity ask questions, all of which were answered her satisfaction. Informed consent was obtained.  

4. Hearing the above, @HE@ was most comfortable proceeding with radiation planning on ***. @HE@ will be NPO for 2 hr and we can use @HIS@ port for IV contrast for planning. We will coordinate with medical oncology in scheduling treatments.  ***Informed consent was obtained.
