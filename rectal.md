# Rectal cancer Contouring summary

## Treatment Planning

- CT Simulation
- IV contrast may be used to delineate GTV and pelvic blood vessels
- Supine with body immobilizaton or
- Prone with use of a belly board for anterior displacement of bowel
  
## Target Volumes

- CTVA: always treated for rectal cancer: internal iliac, pre-sacral, and peri-rectal
- CTVB: external iliac nodal region
- CTVC: inguinal nodal region
- For rectal cancer, in most cases, CTVA would be the only volume to receive elective RT
- For certain presentations (e.g. extension into GU structures, extension to the peri-anal skin) one could consider adding the external iliac (CTVB) and even the inguinal regions (CTVC)

## Target Volumes: CTVA

- Inferior
- At least 2 cm caudad to gross disease, including coverage of the entire mesorectum to the pelvic floor
- Posterior and lateral
- Lateral pelvic sidewall musculature or, where absent, the bone
- Anterior
  - ~1 cm into the posterior bladder and the posterior portion of the internal obturator vessels
- Superior
  - Primary: the rectosigmoid junction or 2 cm proximal to the superior extent of macroscopic disease
  - LN: where the common iliac vessels bifurcate into external/internal iliacs (approximate boney landmark: sacral promontory)
- PTV margin should be ~0.7 to 1.0 cm, except at skin.
